# How to annotate
Annotations can only be made inside a paragraph.
The text of the annotation goes inside an \<em\> tag with the class "notiz". If it contains a question, you can also add the class "frage", this will highlight it on the quote sheet.
The \<em\> tag with the text should come before the place in the text you want to add it to. This place has to be enclosed inside another \<em\> tag with the class "anker".
